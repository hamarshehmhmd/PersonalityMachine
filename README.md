# PersonalityMachine


To run the following program please ensure to have package "sklearn.ensemble" and from it import RandomForestClassifier


About this Project:

This program uses a machine learning model called a random forest classifier to analyze the user's responses to the questions and predict their personality type. The model has been trained on a dataset of responses and personality types, so it can use the patterns it learned from this data to make a prediction for the user's personality type based on their responses.
Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and a more sophisticated and accurate personality analysis would likely require a more complex and finely tuned machine learning model and a larger and more diverse dataset for training.
